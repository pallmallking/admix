Consider f4(l1, l2, r1, r2)  
Suppose at some snp l2 is missing, but the allele frequencies of r1, r2 match.  Then whatever l2 f4 is zero  
Similarly f4=0 if the frequncy of l1 and l2 match, 

qpAdm
qpWave
qpF4ratio
qpf4diff  

use this trick. 

Arie Shaus pointed out to me that this can bias f4 down toward 0.  
To disable, code in the parameter file 

fancyf4:  NO
